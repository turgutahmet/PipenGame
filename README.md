There are pipes that you can move in this game. Besides, you can't move some pipes. These pipes are painted with blue as starting pipes, painted with yellow as end pipes and painted with red as static pipes. Movable pipes can only move up, down, left and right. You can only move pipes to free areas. There is no cross-motion. Starting with level 1, the game continues up to Level 6. You will not be able to access the upper levels without going to Level 1. There are a meter counting your every move in . This counter is your score. If you place these pipes correctly, a ball will appear immediately in the starting position and the ball will start to slide. When the ball reaches the end point, you are considered successful and the upper level button becomes active.
